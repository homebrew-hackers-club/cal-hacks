# History of Hackathons

> "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." — Steve Jobs

Hackathons have become a cornerstone of modern tech culture, but where did they come from? Join us on a journey through the evolution of these intensive coding marathons, from their underground beginnings to becoming global platforms for innovation and collaboration.

## 🕰️ The Origins (1990s)

### What is a "Hackathon"?

The term "hackathon" is a portmanteau of **"hack"** and **"marathon"**. In tech culture, "hack" doesn't mean malicious intrusion—it refers to exploratory programming, creative problem-solving, and unconventional methods to achieve goals.

### The OpenBSD Team (1999)

While the exact origin is debated, the first documented event using the term "hackathon" was held by the **OpenBSD team** in 1999. The team gathered in Calgary, Canada, for a concentrated period of collaborative coding focused on enhancing the OpenBSD operating system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Small, focused team
- In-person collaboration
- Technical problem-solving
- Open source contribution

### Early Purpose

These initial events were purely technical—groups of developers working together to:
- Debug complex issues
- Implement new features
- Write documentation
- Collaborate on open-source projects

*There were no prizes, no sponsors, no judging panels—just coders coding.*
